A disassembly of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

This branch in particular is a disassembly of the build of Sonic 2 found in Sonic Classics, also known as Sonic Compilation.

To build this, use build.bat if you're a Windows user, or build.lua otherwise. The built ROM will be called 's2built.bin'.

The Lua script requires Lua version 5.3. Earlier versions will cause errors about integer divisions ('//') and bit-shifts ('<<', '>>') not being recognised.
