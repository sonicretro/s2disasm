# s2disasm

A disassembly of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

### How to build

To build this, use build.bat if you're a Windows user, or build.sh otherwise. The built ROM will be called 's2built.bin'.

If you're a non-Windows user, you'll have to install the [AS Macro Assembler](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as). This disassembly targets 1.42 Build 89. Later versions are known to not work.  
The original Build 89 features a particularly glaring bug, so the source to a bugfixed version can be found [here](https://github.com/Clownacy/as-sonic).

Non-Windows users will also need to install GCC's C compiler, as the rest of the build tools are compiled from source when build.sh is first ran.
